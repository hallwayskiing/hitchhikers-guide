## Towel
A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have. Partly it has great practical value - you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini raft down the slow heavy river Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mind-boggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you - daft as a bush, but very ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.

## Babel Fish
The Babel fish is small, yellow and leech-like, and probably the oddest thing in the Universe. It feeds on brainwave energy received not from its own carrier but from those around it. It absorbs all unconscious mental frequencies from this brainwave energy to nourish itself with. It then excretes into the mind of its carrier a telepathic matrix formed by combining the conscious thought frequencies with nerve signals picked up from the speech centres of the brain which has supplied them. The practical upshot of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in your ear you can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of language.

## Vogons
Vogons are one of the most unpleasant races in the Galaxy. Not actually evil, but bad-tempered, bureaucratic, officious and callous. They wouldn't even lift a finger to save their own grandmothers from the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal without orders signed in triplicate, sent in, sent back, queried, lost, found, subjected to public inquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft peat for three months and recycled as firelighters.

## Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster
The effect of a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick.

## Earth
Mostly Harmless. (Updated from "Harmless")

## Buffered Analgesic
A standard pharmaceutical preparation designed to alleviate the sensation of one's brain being used as a anvil by a particularly enthusiastic blacksmith. Essential for surviving Thursday mornings.

## Tea
A substance that is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea. In its pure form, it is the cornerstone of British civilization. Its absence is the primary cause of Arthur Dent's existential dread.

## Mr. Prosser
A man who is, in many ways, exactly like a bulldozer, only with more personal problems and a slightly more complex relationship with his ancestors.

## 42
The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. It was calculated by Deep Thought over a period of seven and a half million years. Unfortunately, no one actually knows what the Question is.
